# Super Mario 64 DOS Port

This is a novelty port of the sm64-port to DOS. Do not expect it to be playable.

## Building Instructions

### Docker

1. Install Docker
2. Build image: `docker build . -t sm64_dos`
3. Run build: `docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",destination=/sm64 -ti sm64_dos make -j4 ENABLE_OPENGL_LEGACY=1`

### Other

Consult the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) for required libraries and steps.

### Notes:

For *best* performance:
 - Use `ENABLE_OPENGL_LEGACY=1` to enable the legacy OpenGL renderer
 - Use `DOS_GL=dmesa` to enable 3Dfx-backed OpenGL instead of software-backed (this only works with legacy OpenGL!)
 - Set `draw_sky` to `false` in `SM64CONF.TXT` to avoid drawing the skybox (saves a lot of cycles in software mode)
 - Set `texture_filtering` to `false` in `SM64CONF.TXT` to disable linear filtering (saves a lot of cycles in software mode)
 - Set `enable_sound` to `false` in `SM64CONF.TXT` to disable sound (saves your ears from an untimely death and some cycles too)
 - Set `enable_fog` to `false` to disable fog (saves a tiny bit)

You can change the maximum amount of skipped frames by changing `frameskip` in `SM64CONF.TXT`.

You can change the resolution by changing `screen_width`, `screen_height`.

In software mode the only resolutions that will work are 320x200 (mode 13h) and 320x240 (mode X).
In 3DFX mode the list of supported resolutions depends on the card, 640x480 is a safe value.

Use `ENABLE_SOFTRAST=1` to enable the experimental custom software renderer. It can be faster than `DOS_GL=osmesa` in some cases, but might be much more buggy.

### 3Dfx mode:

When `DOS_GL` is set to `dmesa`, the game will render using FXMesa, which uses 3Dfx Glide for rendering.
That means you will need a 3Dfx card (Voodoo II and above recommended, but will run on a Voodoo I probably) and appropriate
drivers to run it.

The drivers can be obtained from this repository (see [this file](lib/glide3/drivers/README.md)). Put the appropriate
`glide3x.dxe` file next to the EXE.

When running Windows 9x, you will have to reboot into DOS mode before running the game for this to work.

dosbox-x and PCem can emulate Voodoo cards for testing purposes.

## Running

1. You'll need a copy of [CWSDPMI.EXE](https://sandmann.dotster.com/cwsdpmi/) alongside the executable.
2. Either `cp build/us_dos/sm64.us.f3dex2e.exe .` or symlink `ln -s build/us_dos/sm64.us.f3dex2e.exe sm64.exe`
3. Run with `dosbox sm64.exe` or try on some real hardware.

## Controls

Controls can be edited as per the PC port, tweak the `SM64CONF.TXT` which is created with defaults upon first run.
